## The way I am
- Please **be passionate** around me, that's the fuel
- **Build fast AND intentionally** - abstract mental models AND diving deep into the hows and whys, having both is the way
- Impulsively trying to **explain computer science to everyone**
- **If I find it worth learning - I'm learning it.** - Oh, limited hours in a day? FINE... I'll prioritize
- *"A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one"* (Yes, that's the actual quote)
- keyboard fast, mouse slow 🦍
