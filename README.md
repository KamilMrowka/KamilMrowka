# I'm a tech enthusiast who fears smart fridges in home networks  

I programmed PLC controllers at school and I thought I might as well try python.  
It snowballed into me three years later understanding that React is in fact a framework.  


## What do I do
**At work I mostly work on any part of the web programming circle**  
backend, frontend, databases, hosting, testing, qa, monitoring etc.  
java-springboot, ts-react/next.js, postgresql/mysql, posthog and many more.

**Outside of work**
I've also done some game dev in **Godot** and vanilla **Java**.  
I've programmed some pretty interesting algorithms.   
**Or when I try to figure something out, I might just write a simulation.**
